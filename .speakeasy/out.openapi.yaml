            Allows to return users in a particular order.
            At the moment, you can order the returned users by their `created_at`,`updated_at`,`email_address`,`web3wallet`,`first_name`,`last_name`,`phone_number`,`username`,`last_active_at`,`last_sign_in_at`.
            In order to specify the direction, you can use the `+/-` symbols prepended in the property to order by.
            For example, if you want users to be returned in descending order according to their `created_at` property, you can use `-created_at`.
            If you don't use `+` or `-`, then `+` is implied. We only support one `order_by` parameter, and if multiple `order_by` parameters are provided, we will only keep the first one. For example,
            if you pass `order_by=username&order_by=created_at`, we will consider only the first `order_by` parameter, which is `username`. The `created_at` parameter will be ignored in this case.

        Update a user's attributes.

        You can set the user's primary contact identifiers (email address and phone numbers) by updating the `primary_email_address_id` and `primary_phone_number_id` attributes respectively.
        Both IDs should correspond to verified identifications that belong to the user.

        You can remove a user's username by setting the username attribute to null or the blank string "".
        This is a destructive action; the identification will be deleted forever.
        Usernames can be removed only if they are optional in your instance settings and there's at least one other identifier which can be used for authentication.

        This endpoint allows changing a user's password. When passing the `password` parameter directly you have two further options.
        You can ignore the password policy checks for your instance by setting the `skip_password_checks` parameter to `true`.
        You can also choose to sign the user out of all their active sessions on any device once the password is updated. Just set `sign_out_of_other_sessions` to `true`.

        Metadata values will not be replaced entirely.
        Instead, a deep merge will be performed.
        Deep means that any nested JSON objects will be merged as well.

        You can remove metadata keys at any level by setting their value to `null`.

        This request returns the list of organization invitations for the instance.
        Results can be paginated using the optional `limit` and `offset` query parameters.
        You can filter them by providing the 'status' query parameter, that accepts multiple values.
        You can change the order by providing the 'order' query parameter, that accepts multiple values.
        You can filter by the invited user email address providing the `query` query parameter.
        The organization invitations are ordered by descending creation date by default.

            Allows to return organization invitations in a particular order.
            At the moment, you can order the returned organization invitations either by their `created_at` or `email_address`.
            In order to specify the direction, you can use the `+/-` symbols prepended in the property to order by.
            For example, if you want organization invitations to be returned in descending order according to their `created_at` property, you can use `-created_at`.
            If you don't use `+` or `-`, then `+` is implied.
            Defaults to `-created_at`.

        The `proxy_url` can be updated only for production instances.
        Update one of the instance's domains. Both primary and satellite domains can be updated.
        If you choose to use Clerk via proxy, use this endpoint to specify the `proxy_url`.
        Whenever you decide you'd rather switch to DNS setup for Clerk, simply set `proxy_url`
        to `null` for the domain. When you update a production instance's primary domain name,
        you have to make sure that you've completed all the necessary setup steps for DNS and
        emails to work. Expect downtime otherwise. Updating a primary domain's name will also
        update the instance's home origin, affecting the default application paths.

        Changing the domain requires updating the [DNS records](https://clerk.com/docs/deployments/overview#dns-records) accordingly, deploying new [SSL certificates](https://clerk.com/docs/deployments/overview#deploy-certificates), updating your Social Connection's redirect URLs and setting the new keys in your code.

        WARNING: Changing your domain will invalidate all current user sessions (i.e. users will be logged out). Also, while your application is being deployed, a small downtime is expected to occur.

            Allows to return machines in a particular order.
            You can order the returned machines by their `name` or `created_at`.
            To specify the direction, use the `+` or `-` symbols prepended to the property to order by.
            For example, to return machines in descending order by `created_at`, use `-created_at`.
            If you don't use `+` or `-`, then `+` is implied.

            Allows to return organizations in a particular order.
            At the moment, you can order the returned organizations either by their `name`, `created_at` or `members_count`.
            In order to specify the direction, you can use the `+/-` symbols prepended in the property to order by.
            For example, if you want organizations to be returned in descending order according to their `created_at` property, you can use `-created_at`.
            If you don't use `+` or `-`, then `+` is implied.
            Defaults to `-created_at`.

        You can specify the `role` for the invited organization member.

        New organization invitations get a "pending" status until they are revoked by an organization administrator or accepted by the invitee.

        The request body supports passing an optional `redirect_url` parameter.
        When the invited user clicks the link to accept the invitation, they will be redirected to the URL provided.
        Use this parameter to implement a custom invitation acceptance flow.

        You can specify the ID of the user that will send the invitation with the `inviter_user_id` parameter.
        That user must be a member with administrator privileges in the organization.
        Only "admin" members can create organization invitations.

        You can optionally provide public and private metadata for the organization invitation.
        The public metadata are visible by both the Frontend and the Backend whereas the private ones only by the Backend.
        When the organization invitation is accepted, the metadata will be transferred to the newly created organization membership.

      summary: Bulk create and send organization invitations
      description: |-
        Creates new organization invitations in bulk and sends out emails to the provided email addresses with a link to accept the invitation and join the organization.

        This endpoint is limited to a maximum of 10 invitations per API call. If you need to send more invitations, please make multiple requests.

        You can specify a different `role` for each invited organization member.
        New organization invitations get a "pending" status until they are revoked by an organization administrator or accepted by the invitee.
        The request body supports passing an optional `redirect_url` parameter for each invitation.
        When the invited user clicks the link to accept the invitation, they will be redirected to the provided URL.
        Use this parameter to implement a custom invitation acceptance flow.
        You can specify the ID of the user that will send the invitation with the `inviter_user_id` parameter. Each invitation
        can have a different inviter user.
        Inviter users must be members with administrator privileges in the organization.
        Only "admin" members can create organization invitations.
        You can optionally provide public and private metadata for each organization invitation. The public metadata are visible
        by both the Frontend and the Backend, whereas the private metadata are only visible by the Backend.
        When the organization invitation is accepted, the metadata will be transferred to the newly created organization membership.

        It tries to verify that the proxy URL provided in the parameters maps to a functional proxy that can reach the Clerk Frontend API.

        You can use this endpoint before you set a proxy URL for a domain. This way you can ensure that switching to proxy-based
        configuration will not lead to downtime for your instance.

        The `proxy_url` parameter allows for testing proxy configurations for domains that don't have a proxy URL yet, or operate on
        a different proxy URL than the one provided. It can also be used to re-validate a domain that is already configured to work with a proxy.

            Allows to return OAuth applications in a particular order.
            At the moment, you can order the returned OAuth applications by their `created_at` and `name`.
            In order to specify the direction, you can use the `+/-` symbols prepended in the property to order by.
            For example, if you want OAuth applications to be returned in descending order according to their `created_at` property, you can use `-created_at`.
            If you don't use `+` or `-`, then `+` is implied. We only support one `order_by` parameter, and if multiple `order_by` parameters are provided, we will only keep the first one. For example,
            if you pass `order_by=name&order_by=created_at`, we will consider only the first `order_by` parameter, which is `name`. The `created_at` parameter will be ignored in this case.
